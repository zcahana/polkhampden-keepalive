# Polk Audio Hampden KeepAlive

Are you an owner of a pair of [Polk Audio](https://www.polkaudio.com/) Hampden desktop speakers?  
Do your speakers go into a power saving mode after a few minutes idle?  
Are you tired of missing a few seconds of audio until your speakes wake up?  

Fear no more!

The script in this repo plays an inaudible (unless you're an elephant) 20Hz infrasonic tone that keeps the speakers active.
Run it periodically every 10 minutes, e.g. with Windows Task Scheduler.

Note: this VBScript is clearly Windows only, but feel free to adapt it to your platform of choice.
